    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bolognese or more traditionally ragu is a classic pasta sauce from
        the region of Emilia-Romagna. In this recipe we follow the 
        <strong>correct</strong> way of doing it, which means we are going
        to use minimal ingredients <em>(no mashed tomatoes!)</em>.

    <h4>Method</h4>
    <ol class="method">
        <li>Heat the olive oil and butter in the pan, add 
            onion, celery, carrot and pancetta. Sweat on low heat until
            onion is softened and pancetta rendered some of it's fat.</li>
        <li>Add meat and cook on high heat. Try to separete the meat into
            small pieces with a wooden spoon. Continue until nicely browned, 
            you should see <em>fond</em> on the bottom of your pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add wine and stir everything. After the alcohol evaporated reduce
            heat to lowest possible setting and add tomato puree and stock. Stir
            everything again.
        </li>
        <li>Cover with a lid and cook on low heat for 2 to 3 hours checking 
            every once and again to see if there is enough liquid. If not 
            just add more stock or water.
        </li>
        <li>
            Before serving transfer (cooked) tagliatelle 
            to the pan with sauce and stir it nicely. If the sauce is too dry
            add the water in which the pasta was cooked. 
        </li>
